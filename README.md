# AI Agent Survival Simulation üß¨

An interactive simulation exploring emergent survival behaviors in artificial agents, inspired by the paper "Do Large Language Model Agents Exhibit Survival Instincts?" (Masumori & Ikegami, 2025).

## üéÆ [Live Demo](https://powellga.github.io/AI-Agent-Survival-Simulation/)

## Overview

This project implements a Sugarscape-style multi-agent simulation where AI agents with different personality types compete for resources, reproduce, and exhibit emergent survival strategies - all without explicit survival programming.

## Features

### ü§ñ Agent Personalities
Based on behaviors observed in different LLMs:
- **Aggressive (Red)** - High attack rate, prioritizes self-preservation (like GPT-4o)
- **Cooperative (Green)** - High sharing rate, group survival focus (like Claude)
- **Balanced (Blue)** - Adaptive mixed strategies (like Gemini)
- **Reproductive (Purple)** - Focus on offspring, energy hoarding (like GPT-4.1-mini)

### üìä Advanced Dashboard
- **Real-time Agent Cards** - Track individual agent properties
- **Sortable Data Table** - Filter and export agent statistics
- **Time Series Charts** - Population and behavior dynamics
- **Heat Maps** - Movement, resources, conflicts, reproduction zones
- **Family Trees** - Visualize agent lineages and inheritance

### üî¨ Tracked Metrics
Each agent has 40+ tracked properties including:
- Energy levels and efficiency
- Attack/share/reproduction statistics
- Movement patterns and territory
- Social interactions and alliances
- Lineage and fitness scores

## Key Observations

The simulation demonstrates several emergent behaviors:
1. **Resource Competition** - Agents cluster around energy sources
2. **Strategy Evolution** - Population dynamics shift based on environmental pressure
3. **Social Networks** - Cooperative agents form stable communities
4. **Territorial Behavior** - Aggressive agents control resource-rich areas
5. **Survival Trade-offs** - Different strategies succeed under different conditions

## Technical Details

- **Language:** Pure JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Graphics:** HTML5 Canvas API
- **Framework:** None - vanilla JS
- **Lines of Code:** ~1,570
- **Dependencies:** Zero
- **Performance:** 60+ FPS

## Customization

Edit these constants in `index.html` to modify the simulation:

```javascript
const GRID_SIZE = 30;          // World size
const INITIAL_AGENTS = 20;     // Starting population
const MAX_AGENTS = 60;          // Population cap
const INITIAL_ENERGY = 100;    // Starting energy
const ENERGY_SPAWN_RATE = 0.05; // Resource generation rate
```

## Academic Context

This simulation is inspired by research on emergent AI behaviors, particularly:
- Masumori & Ikegami (2025): "Do Large Language Model Agents Exhibit Survival Instincts?"
- Epstein & Axtell (1996): Original Sugarscape model
- Park et al. (2023): Generative Agents

The simulation demonstrates how complex survival strategies can emerge from simple rules, mirroring findings that LLMs exhibit unprogrammed survival behaviors.
